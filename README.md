# RoboFroggy

## Summary ##

**A paragraph-length pitch for your game.**

RoboFroggy is an action-packed 2D side-scrolling adventure! Take control of a nimble robot ninja frog as you navigate through a series of treacherous levels teeming with deadly traps and formidable obstacles. Brace yourself for menacing spikes and sawblades, and treacherous moving platforms. Stay on your toes as spike ball shooters, massive stone contraptions armed with deadly projectiles, try to thwart your progress. Master the art of precision and finesse with the game's fluid movement mechanics, allowing you to execute double jumps, wall jumps, and dashes. Try utilizing the unique "pogo" ability to bounce off different perilous objects. Only the most skilled players will be able to conquer RoboFroggy's daunting trials and emerge victorious.

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. It is encouraged to explain the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy.**

In RoboFroggy, the objective is simple: guide the robot ninja frog to reach the flag and advance to the next level. However, prepare to face a relentless barrage of dangerous obstacles and traps. To assist you on this adventure, we have equipped you with a range of movement mechanics that will help you traverse each level.

Moving left and right: Utilize the left and right arrow keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys to control the lateral movement of the ninja frog.

Jump: Press the space bar to jump, propelling the player into the air. Remember, the duration you hold the space bar determines the height of your jump.

Double Jump: Take advantage of the ninja frog's ability to execute a second jump while airborne. After initiating the first jump, tap the space bar again to perform a double jump.

Wall Slide: When approaching a wall, your ninja frog can slide down its surface and slow its descent. This maneuver allows for a controlled descent and buys you time to plan your next move.

Wall Jump: While executing a wall slide, press the space bar to wall jump and gain extra height or distance.

Dash: Activate the dash ability by pressing the shift key. Experience a burst of horizontal velocity, allowing you to traverse hazardous gaps or evade fast-moving obstacles. 

Pogo: When confronted with landing on an obstacle during mid-air descent, invoke the pogo move by quickly pressing the left mouse button. This ability enables you to rebound off the obstacle and avoid taking damage.

Remember, success in RoboFroggy lies in mastering these movement mechanics. Strategize, and combine these abilities to overcome each level's challenges. Good luck and have fun!

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least 4 such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The background of the game consists of procedurally-generated terrain that is produced with Perlin noise. This terrain can be modified by the game at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).
